# Light Sleeper

Waking up to a blaring alarm isn't very good.

Being able to disable or snooze that alarm from the side of your bed also isn't great.

Wouldn't it be better to train and use your body's in-built Circadian Rhythm?

Light Sleeper is all about waking up to light.

## How it works

By replacing the bedroom light with a LIFX bulb and using this system to control it, I hope to replace my conventional alarm clock. The LIFX bulb is controlled on a schedule using a combination of Crontab and Ruby scripts.
