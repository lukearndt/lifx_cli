# Light Sleeper

Let's be honest.

Waking up to a blaring alarm isn't much fun. It's annoying. It's unpleasant. Who wants their first thought every day to be "Argh, turn off that noise!"?

Wouldn't it be better to train and use your body's in-built Circadian Rhythm?

Light Sleeper is all about waking up to light.

## How it works

By replacing the bedroom light with a LIFX bulb and using this system to control it, I hope to replace my conventional alarm clock. The LIFX bulb is controlled on a schedule using a combination of Crontab and Ruby scripts.
